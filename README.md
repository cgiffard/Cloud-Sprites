A collection of isometric sprites for drawing diagrams of your cloud infrastructure,
pictures of servers and associated technology, or whatever else you can think of!

## Usage

Install the sketch document as a library, and use locally in your own sketch documents. Raster and vector images of individual sprites are coming soon.
